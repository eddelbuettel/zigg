### Motivation

Random-numbers are widely used for simulation, estimation and exploration. Many excellent
pseudo-random number generators are available, and the literature keeps evolving. [George
Marsaglia][marsaglia] had introduced a number of these, as well as the test battery [diehard][diehard]
(later extended by [Robert Brown][rgb] in [dieharder][dieharder], see also the [github
repo][dieharder gh]).

A particular generator, [Ziggurat][ziggurat], was introduced in a [JSS paper in 2000][jss2000] by
[Marsaglia] and Tsang. A small correction appeared in a [JSS paper in 2005][jss2005] by Leong et al.
This version, along with improvements due to [Burkhardt][burkardt] and [Voss][voss], is provided in
our R package [RcppZiggurat][rcppziggurat], along with other implementations allowing for detailed
comparison.

However, this existing R package provides a heavier build, and imposes run-time limits as it also
links to the GNU GSL (for the method by [Voss][voss]) as well as implementation from [gretl][gretl]
and [quantlib][quantlib]. The new package assembled here offers a lighterweight alternative. It can
be called directly from R, and also offers a C(++)-callable interface other packages can use in
their native code.

### Example

The following chart is generated by the example script [demo/timings.R][timings]

![](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/images/2025-01-05/ziggurat_base_R_comparison.png)

It shows that the speed gains from `zigg` relative to base R are (for this example, on our machine)
on the order of 7.4, 5.2, and 4.7 for the normal, exponential, and uniform RRNGs.

That said, the actual time drawing random numbers will likely only affect a fraction of the run-time
of study so you may well consider sticking with high-quality, well-tested, and widely-deployed
default generators in R.  This package provides a useful illustration of how and older and simpler
generator can be lighter and faster (at possibly a lesser total period etc).

### Installation

The code is provided as an R package so a standard installation from the repository via

```r
remotes::install_packages("zigg")
```

work. The package has no dependencies.

Moreover, the package can be installed (as binary, where available, or source) from its
[r-universe][runiverse] repository via

```r
urls <- c("https://eddelbuettel.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org")
install.packages('zigg', repos = urls)
```

and is also available as an Ubuntu binary, see [the docs for that][runiverseubuntu]).
