Description: 'Ziggurat', introduced by Marsaglia and Tsang (2000, <doi:10.18637/jss.v005.i08>)
 and improved by Leong et al (2005, <doi:10.18637/jss.v012.i07>) offers a lightweight and very
 fast PRNG for normal, exponential, and uniform distributions. It is provided here in a small
 zero-dependency package, and can be used from R as well as from C(++) code in other packages. An
 example client package is included in this package as well. The implementation is influenced by
 our older package 'RcppZiggurat' which offers a comparisone among multiple alternative
 implementations. These PRNGs provided are generally faster than the ones in base R: on our machine,
 the relative gains for normal, exponential and uniform are on the order of 7.4, 5.2 and 4.7 times
 faster than base R. However, these generators are of potentially lesser quality so if in doubt use
 of the base R function generatrs remains the general recommendation.
