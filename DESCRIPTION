Description: 'Ziggurat' by Marsaglia and Tsang (2000, <doi:10.18637/jss.v005.i08>) and improved by
 Leong et al (2005, <doi:10.18637/jss.v012.i07>) offers a lightweight and fast PRNG for normal,
 exponential, and uniform distributions which is offered here for use from R. The implementation
 leans on the one in package 'RcppZiggurat' which offers a comparisone among multiple alternative
 implementations. These PRNGs provided are generally faster than the ones in base R, but should be
 consider to be of potentially lesser quality so if in doubt use of the base R functions is
 recommended. However, for certain more explorative use the functions provided here should prove
 useful too.
