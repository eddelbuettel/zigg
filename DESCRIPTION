Description: 'Ziggurat', originally introduced by Marsaglia and Tsang (2000,
 <doi:10.18637/jss.v005.i08>) and further improved by Leong et al (2005,
 <doi:10.18637/jss.v012.i07>) offers a lightweight and very fast pseudo-random
 number generator (or 'PRNG') for the normal, exponential, and uniform
 distributions. It is provided here in a small zero-dependency package. It can
 be used from R as well as from C(++) code in other packages as is demonstrated
 by four included sample packages using four distinct methods to use the PRNG
 presented here in client package. The implementation is influenced by our older
 package 'RcppZiggurat' which offers a comparisone among multiple alternative
 implementations. These PRNGs provided are generally faster than the ones in
 base R: on our machine, the relative gains for normal, exponential and uniform
 are on the order of 7.4, 5.2 and 4.7 times faster than base R. However, these
 generators are of potentially lesser quality so if in doubt use of the base R
 function generatrs remains the general recommendation.
